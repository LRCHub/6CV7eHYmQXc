Why that person would, again, become conscious?

I took one last sip got an ambulance trip
Breathalyzer told em it was .46
Doc on duty wasn't having my shit
Took one little look, I was in and out quick
Wait around a lot till the tech showed up
Went back to detox, didn't even throw up
Sweating through the sheets, just shaking
Thinking of you

Welcome home, give up your phone
Clonazepam, trazodone
We'll get high, while we get dry
So we don't die, I suppose

Baby, baby, do you love me
Even though I'm in recovery
DTs feel like light lightning struck me
But I'm just struck by you
Weakness pulled apart by vultures
Insides ripped apart by ulcers
Every day I'm getting older
But I wanna get older with you

Welcome home, give up your phone
Clonazepam, trazodone
We'll get high, while we get dry
So we don't die, I suppose
Welcome home, give up your phone
Ativan, trazodone
We'll get high, while we get dry
So we don't die, I suppose
