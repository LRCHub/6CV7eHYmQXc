In high seas or in low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be your friend
In high tide or in low tide
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
I heard her praying, praying, praying
I said, I heard my mother
She was praying in the night (Praying praying praying praying)
And the words that she said (the words that she said)
They still linger in my head (linger in my head)
She said, "A child is born in this world
He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we're wrong, please correct us
And stand by me"
In high seas or in low seas
I'm gonna be your friend, Yes I
I'll be your friend
In high tide or in low tide
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
I said I heard my mother
She was crying in the night (I heard her crying crying crying)
And the tears that she shed (the year that she shed)
They still linger in my head (linger in my head)
"A child is born in this world
She needs protection
God, guide us and protect us .when we're wrong, please correct us
And stand by me"
In high seas or in low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
Yes, I will
In high tide or in low
I'll be
I'll be, I'll be by your side
