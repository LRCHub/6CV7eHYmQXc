Low tide the season brings me
No more sheltered pools to feed in
How can I make my dreams come true

I am in isolation
One by one they've taken my friends
However I got here
God only knew

[Chorus]
When it was easier
It was easier
We couldn't turn our heads and look the other way
When it was easier
It was easier
We couldn't turn our heads and look the other way

Sun filters through this grey mess
Fills my days with drunken happiness
Don't ask when your wishes will come true

Ah-ha∦
I am in isolation
And one by one they've taken my friends
However I got here
God only knew, yeah

Then it was easier
It was easier
We couldn't turn our heads and look the other way
When it was easier
It was easier
We couldn't turn our heads and look the other way

And would it feel like heaven
Would it feel like hell
Would it feel like heaven

[Instrumental]

This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself

This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself

This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself
This dream is dreaming itself

This dream is dreaming itself
This dream'
Is dreaming itself

For you
Only for you
For you
